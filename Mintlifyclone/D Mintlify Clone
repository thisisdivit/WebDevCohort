Project Overview

This project is a desktop-only clone of the Mintlify documentation website built using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to closely replicate the structure, layout, typography, and visual style of the original Mintlify website while strictly following the provided constraints. The focus is on clean layout, readable documentation-style design, and accurate section placement rather than interactivity or responsiveness.

Website Structure

The website starts with a top navigation bar containing the Mintlify logo, navigation links, and a primary call-to-action button. This is followed by a hero section that includes a strong main headline, a short descriptive paragraph, an email input field with a CTA button, and a large background illustration to visually represent the product.

Below the hero area, a documentation preview section is displayed using a static sidebar-style navigation on the left and main content cards on the right to mimic a real documentation layout. A Trusted By section showcases a row of company logos to build credibility.

The page continues with feature highlight sections, designed in a two-column layout where text and visuals are placed side-by-side. An intelligent assistant / UI preview section presents a large interface mockup with a short explanation of its functionality.

An enterprise features section introduces advanced capabilities such as security and compliance using a title, short introduction, and multiple feature blocks. This is followed by case studies or customer stories, displayed in a card-based layout with images and brief descriptions.

The page ends with a final call-to-action section featuring a strong heading and CTA buttons, and a footer that includes multi-column links along with company and legal information.
